The pre­ vious studies showed interesting results regarding the diagnostic efficiency of AI methods in differentiating Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients from healthy controls or other demyelinating diseases. There is a great lack of a comprehensive systematic review study on the role of AI in the diagnosis of MS. We aimed to perform a sys­ tematic review to document the performance of AI in MS diagnosis. Methods: : A systematic search was performed using four databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE on August 2021. All original studies which focused on deep learning or AI to analyze any modalities with the purpose of diagnosing MS were included in our study. Results: : Finally, 38 studies were included in our systematic review after the abstract and full-text screening. A total of 5433 individuals were included, including 2924 cases of MS and 2509 healthy controls. Sensitivity and specificity were reported in 29 studies which ranged from 76.92 to 100 for sensitivity and 74 to 100 for spec­ ificity. Furthermore, 34 studies reported accuracy ranged 81 to 100. Among included studies, Magnetic Reso­ nance Imaging (MRI) (20 studies), OCT (six studies), serum and cerebrospinal fluid markers (six studies), movement function (three studies), and other modalities such as breathing and evoked potential was used for detecting MS via AI. Conclusion: : In conclusion, diagnosis of MS based on new markers and AI is a growing field of research with MRI images, followed by images obtained from OCT, serum and CSF biomarkers, and motor associated markers. All of these results show that with advances made in AI, the way we monitor and diagnose our MS patients can change drastically.","2022-03","2022-11-30 21:59:28","2022-11-30 21:59:29","2022-11-30 21:59:28","103673","","","59","","Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","Artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/R4RDPJ5A/1-s2.0-S0010482521004911.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/P5HNA8ZY/1927.full.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/GQE4CIQ8/00006114-202111230-00004.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/D4CD7EBJ/5154896.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/8ZND3ITQ/0846537120954293.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/5GF6LFBT/a-1167-8402.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/SHSCEVTX/Deep-Learning Generated Synthetic Double Inversion Recovery Images Improve Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Detection.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/8Y3DTMZR/fneur-12-685276.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/47XXG9VX/Journal of Neuroimaging - 2021 - Platten - Deep Learning Corpus Callosum Segmentation as a Neurodegenerative Marker in.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/KB2MZ7HZ/Nabizadeh et al. - 2022 - Artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of multip.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/AHMXZ8GY/NMR in Biomedicine - 2020 - Maggi - CVSnet  A machine learning approach for automated central vein sign assessment in.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/A9WSZ85H/s41746-020-0229-3.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/FACK5A4X/tariq2020.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The promise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as tools to address problems in MS research has attracted increasing interest in these methods. Bayesian networks offer a clear advantage since they can integrate data and causal knowledge allowing for visualizing interactions between dependent variables and potential confounding factors. A review of AI/ML research methods applied to MS found 216 papers using terms “Multiple Sclerosis”, “machine learning”, “artificial intelligence”, “Bayes”, and “Bayesian”, of which 90 were relevant and recently published. More than half of these involve the detection and segmentation of MS lesions for quantitative analysis; however clinical and lifestyle risk factor assessment and prediction have largely been ignored. Of those that address risk factors, most provide only association studies for some factors and often fail to include the potential impact of confounding factors and bias (especially where these have causal explanations) that could affect data interpretation, such as reporting quality and medical care access in various countries. To address these gaps in the literature, we propose a causal Bayesian network approach to assessing risk factors for MS, which can address deficiencies in current epidemiological methods of producing risk measurements and makes better use of observational data.","2021-05","2022-11-30 21:59:39","2022-11-30 21:59:39","2022-11-30 21:59:39","104337","","","132","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/YBLK2L7B/Hartmann et al. - 2021 - Current review and next steps for artificial intel.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diagnosis of this disease is a very complex process and generally requires a lot of time. In addition, treatments are applied without any information on the disability course in each MS patient. For these two reasons, the objective of this study was to improve the MS diagnosis and predict the long-term course of disability in MS patients based on clinical data and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Material and methods: A total of 104 healthy controls and 108 MS patients, 82 of whom had a 10-year follow-up, were enrolled. Classification algorithms such as multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machines (SVM), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbours (k-NN), Naïve Bayes (NB), ensemble classifier (EC) and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network were tested to develop two predictive models: MS diagnosis model and MS disability course prediction model. Results: For MS diagnosis, the best result was obtained using EC (accuracy: 87.7%; sensitivity: 87.0%; specificity: 88.5%; precision: 88.7%; AUC: 0.8775). In line with this good performance, the accuracy was 85.4% using k-NN and 84.4% using SVM. And, for long-term prediction of MS disability course, LSTM recurrent neural network was the most appropriate classifier (accuracy: 81.7%; sensitivity: 81.1%; specificity: 82.2%; precision: 78.9%; AUC: 0.8165). The use of MLR, SVM and k-NN also showed a good performance (AUC ≥ 0.8). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that machine learning techniques, using clinical and OCT data, can help establish an early diagnosis and predict the course of MS. This advance could help clinicians select more specific treatments for each MS patient. Therefore, our findings underscore the potential of RNFL thickness as a reliable MS biomarker.","2021-06","2022-11-30 21:59:41","2022-11-30 21:59:41","2022-11-30 21:59:41","104416","","","133","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/5DKQ8XWJ/Montolío et al. - 2021 - Machine learning in diagnosis and disability predi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: To determine how well an automatically-generated quantitative snapshot of brain pathology, measured only on clinical routine T2-FLAIR MRI, can substitute for more conventional measures on research MRI in terms of capturing multi-factorial disease pathology and providing similar clinical relevance. Methods: MRI with both research-quality sequences and conventional clinical T2-FLAIR was acquired for 172 MS patients at baseline, and neurologic disability was assessed at baseline and five-years later. Five measures (thalamus volume, lateral ventricle volume, medulla oblongata volume, lesion volume, and network efficiency) for quantifying disparate aspects of neuropathology from low-resolution T2-FLAIR were applied to predict standard research-quality MRI measures. They were compared in regard to association with future neurologic disability and disease progression over five years. Results: The combination of the five T2-FLAIR measures explained most of the variance in standard researchquality MRI. T2-FLAIR measures were associated with neurologic disability and cognitive function five-years later (R2 = 0.279, p < 0.001; R2 = 0.382, p < 0.001), similar to standard research-quality MRI (R2 = 0.279, p < 0.001; R2 = 0.366, p < 0.001). They also similarly predicted disability progression over five years (%-correctly-classified = 69.8, p = 0.034), compared to standard research-quality MRI (%-correctly-classified = 72.4%, p = 0.022) in relapsing-remitting MS. Conclusion: A set of five T2-FLAIR-only measures can substitute for standard research-quality MRI, especially in relapsing-remitting MS. When only clinical T2-FLAIR is available, it can be used to obtain substantially more quantitative information about brain pathology and disability than is currently standard practice.","2021","2022-11-30 21:59:48","2022-11-30 21:59:48","2022-11-30 21:59:48","102705","","","31","","NeuroImage: Clinical","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/4Y77346W/Fuchs et al. - 2021 - Quantifying disease pathology and predicting disea.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ability to predict the risk of attacks in a given time frame can be used to identify patients who are likely to beneﬁt from more proactive treatment. In this paper, we aim to determine whether deep learning can extract, from segmented lesion masks, latent features that can predict short-term disease activity in patients with early MS symptoms more accurately than lesion volume, which is a very commonly used MS imaging biomarker. More speciﬁcally, we use convolutional neural networks to extract latent MS lesion patterns that are associated with early disease activity using lesion masks computed from baseline MR images. The main challenges are that lesion masks are generally sparse and the number of training samples is small relative to the dimensionality of the images. To cope with sparse voxel data, we propose utilizing the Euclidean distance transform (EDT) for increasing information density by populating each voxel with a distance value. To reduce the risk of overﬁtting resulting from high image dimensionality, we use a synergistic combination of downsampling, unsupervised pretraining, and regularization during training. A detailed analysis of the impact of EDT and unsupervised pretraining is presented. Using the MRIs from 140 subjects in a 7-fold cross-validation procedure, we demonstrate that our prediction model can achieve an accuracy rate of 72.9 % (SD = 10.3 %) over 2 years using baseline MR images only, which is signiﬁcantly higher than the 65.0 % (SD = 14.6 %) that is attained with the traditional MRI biomarker of lesion load.","2016","2022-11-30 21:59:49","2022-11-30 21:59:50","2022-11-30 21:59:49","86-94","","","10008","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Series Title: Lecture Notes in Computer Science DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-46976-8_10","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/JZDGT3CN/Yoo et al. - 2016 - Deep Learning of Brain Lesion Patterns for Predict.pdf","","","","Carneiro, Gustavo; Mateus, Diana; Peter, Loïc; Bradley, Andrew; Tavares, João Manuel R.

Using detailed expert annotations, artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms can be trained on such MSspeciﬁc data. Second, understanding disease processes could be greatly advanced through shared data of large MS cohorts with clinical, demographic, and treatment information. Relevant patterns in such data that may be imperceptible to a human observer could be detected through artiﬁcial intelligence techniques. This applies from image analysis (lesions, atrophy, or functional network changes) to large multidomain datasets (imaging, cognition, clinical disability, genetics). After reviewing data sharing and artiﬁcial intelligence, we highlight 3 areas that oﬀer strong opportunities for making advances in the next few years: crowdsourcing, personal data protection, and organized analysis challenges.

In this respect, we used machine learning to predict disease activity status in patients with MS and identify the most predictive covariates of this activity. The analysis is conducted on a pooled population of 1935 patients enrolled in three cladribine tablets clinical trials with different outcomes: relapsing–­remitting MS (from CLARITY and CLARITY-­Extension trials) and patients experiencing a first demyelinating event (from the ORACLE-­MS trial). We applied gradient-­boosting (from XgBoost library) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) methods to identify patients' covariates that predict disease activity 3 and 6 months before their clinical observation, including patient baseline characteristics, longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging readouts, and neurological and laboratory measures. The most predictive covariates for early identification of disease activity in patients were found to be treatment duration, higher number of new combined unique active lesion count, higher number of new T1 hypointense black holes, and higher age-­related MS severity score. The outcome of this analysis improves our understanding of the mechanism of onset of disease activity in patients with MS by allowing their early identification in clinical settings and prompting preventive measures, therapeutic interventions, or more frequent patient monitoring.","2022-07","2022-11-30 21:59:57","2023-01-28 14:53:34","2022-11-30 21:59:57","843-853","","7","11","","CPT Pharmacom & Syst Pharma","Predicting disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/ZTBUGUCI/Basu et al. - 2022 - Predicting disease activity in patients with multi.pdf","","Read; Key","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explore different machine learning (ML) approaches to predict whether a patient will shift from the initial Relapsing-Remitting (RR) to the Secondary Progressive (SP) form of the disease, using only “real world” data available in clinical routine. The clinical records of 1624 outpatients (207 in the SP phase) attending the MS service of Sant’Andrea hospital, Rome, Italy, were used. Predictions at 180, 360 or 720 days from the last visit were obtained considering either the data of the last available visit (Visit-Oriented setting), comparing four classical ML methods (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours and AdaBoost) or the whole clinical history of each patient (History-Oriented setting), using a Recurrent Neural Network model, specifically designed for historical data. Missing values were handled by removing either all clinical records presenting at least one missing parameter (Feature-saving approach) or the 3 clinical parameters which contained missing values (Record-saving approach). The performances of the classifiers were rated using common indicators, such as Recall (or Sensitivity) and Precision (or Positive predictive value). In the visit-oriented setting, the Record-saving approach yielded Recall values from 70% to 100%, but low Precision (5% to 10%), which however increased to 50% when considering only predictions for which the model returned a probability above a given “confidence threshold”. For the History-oriented setting, both indicators increased as prediction time lengthened, reaching values of 67% (Recall) and 42% (Precision) at 720 days. We show how “real world” data can be effectively used to forecast the evolution of MS, leading to high Recall values and propose innovative approaches to improve Precision towards clinically useful values.","2020-03-20","2022-11-30 21:59:58","2022-11-30 21:59:58","2022-11-30 21:59:58","e0230219","","3","15","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/FAZGPH86/Seccia et al. - 2020 - Considering patient clinical history impacts perfo.pdf","","","","Lolli, Francesco","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results  At follow-up, 36% of participants showed disability progression. The classifier with the highest resulting metrics had accuracy of 0.79, area under the true positive versus false positive rates curve of 0.81, sensitivity of 0.90 and specificity of 0.71.

People with the lesion-led subtype have the highest risk of confirmed disability progression (CDP) and the highest relapse rate.

The model uses parallel convolutional pathways, an idea introduced by the popular Inception net (Szegedy et al., 2015) and is trained and tested on two large proprietary, multi-scanner, multi-center, clinical trial datasets of patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). Experiments on 465 patients on the placebo arms of the trials indicate that the model can accurately predict future disease progression, measured by a sustained increase in the extended disability status scale (EDSS) score over time. Using only the multi-modal MRI provided at baseline, the model achieves an AUC of 0.66 ± 0.055. However, when supplemental lesion label masks are provided as inputs as well, the AUC increases to 0.701 ± 0.027. Furthermore, we demonstrate that uncertainty estimates based on Monte Carlo dropout sample variance correlate with errors made by the model. Clinicians provided with the predictions computed by the model can therefore use the associated uncertainty estimates to assess which scans require further examination.","","2022-11-30 22:00:40","2022-11-30 22:00:40","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/H2ZTJYPF/Tousignant et al. - Prediction of Disease Progression in Multiple Scle.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 2017 McDonald criteria show high sensitivity and accuracy in predicting a second clinical attack in patients with a typical clinically isolated syndrome and allow an earlier diagnosis of MS. They have been validated, are evidence-based, simplify the clinical use of MRI criteria and improve MS patients’ management. However, to limit the risk of misdiagnosis, they should be applied by expert clinicians only after the careful exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Recently, new MRI markers have been proposed to improve diagnostic specificity for MS and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. The central vein sign and chronic active lesions (i.e., paramagnetic rim lesions) may increase the specificity of MS diagnostic criteria, but further effort is necessary to validate and standardize their assessment before implementing them in the clinical setting. The feasibility of subpial demyelination assessment and the clinical relevance of leptomeningeal enhancement evaluation in the diagnostic work-up of MS appear more limited. Artificial intelligence tools may capture MRI attributes that are beyond the human perception, and, in the future, artificial intelligence may complement human assessment to further ameliorate the diagnostic work-up and patients’ classification. However, guidelines that ensure reliability, interpretability, and validity of findings obtained from artificial intelligence approaches are still needed to implement them in the clinical scenario.

AI surveillance programs may help radiologists prioritize work lists by identifying suspicious or positive cases for early review. AI programs can be used to extract “radiomic” information from images not discernible by visual inspection, potentially increasing the diagnostic and prognostic value derived from image datasets. Predictions have been made that suggest AI will put radiologists out of business. This issue has been overstated, and it is much more likely that radiologists will beneﬁcially incorporate AI methods into their practices. Current limitations in availability of technical expertise and even computing power will be resolved over time and can also be addressed by remote access solutions.

Other fields of application have been improvement of MRI protocols as well as automated lesion and tissue segmentation.

Materials and Methods:               A dataset composed of 90 MS patients acquired at the MS clinic of Lyon Neurological Hospital was used for the analysis. Four MS profiles were considered, corresponding to Clinical Isolated Syndrome (CIS), Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS), Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS), and Primary Progressive MS (PPMS). Each patient was classified in one of these profiles by our neurologist and underwent longitudinal MRI examinations including T1-weighted image acquisition at each examination, from which the GM tissue was segmented and the cortical GM thickness measured. Following the GM parcellation using two different atlases (FSAverage and Glasser 2016), the morphological connectome was built and six global metrics (Betweenness Centrality (BC), Assortativity (               r               ), Transitivity (T), Efficiency (               E                                g                              ), Modularity (Q) and Density (D)) were extracted. Based on their connectivity metrics, MS profiles were first statistically compared and second, classified using four different learning machines (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and AdaBoost), combined in a higher level ensemble model by majority voting. Finally, the impact of the GM spatial resolution on the MS clinical profiles classification was analyzed.                                         Results:               Using binary comparisons between the four MS clinical profiles, statistical differences and classification performances higher than 0.7 were observed. Good performances were obtained when comparing the two early clinical forms, RRMS and PPMS (F1 score of 0.86), and the two neurodegenerative profiles, PPMS and SPMS (F1 score of 0.72). When comparing the two atlases, slightly better performances were obtained with the Glasser 2016 atlas, especially between RRMS with PPMS (F1 score of 0.83), compared to the FSAverage atlas (F1 score of 0.69). Also, the thresholding value for graph binarization was investigated suggesting more informative graph properties in the percentile range between 0.6 and 0.8.                                         Conclusion:               An automated pipeline was proposed for the classification of MS clinical profiles using six global graph metrics extracted from the GM morphological connectome of MS patients.

To date, no prognostic factors or risk score have been validated to predict disease course in single individuals. This is increasingly frustrating, since several treatments can prevent relapses and slow progression, even for a long time, although the possible adverse effects are relevant, in particular for the more effective drugs. An early prediction of disease course would allow differentiation of the treatment based on the expected aggressiveness of the disease, reserving high-impact therapies for patients at greater risk. To increase prognostic capacity, approaches based on machine learning (ML) algorithms are being attempted, given the failure of other approaches. Here we review recent studies that have used clinical data, alone or with other types of data, to derive prognostic models. Several algorithms that have been used and compared are described.

Purpose:  To evaluate an AI system for generation of differential diagnoses at brain MRI compared with radiologists. Materials and Methods:  This retrospective study tested performance of an AI system for probabilistic diagnosis in patients with 19 common and rare diagnoses at brain MRI acquired between January 2008 and January 2018. The AI system combines data-driven and domain-expertise methodologies, including deep learning and Bayesian networks. First, lesions were detected by using deep learning. Then, 18 quantitative imaging features were extracted by using atlas-based coregistration and segmentation. Third, these image features were combined with five clinical features by using Bayesian inference to develop probability-ranked differential diagnoses. Quantitative feature extraction algorithms and conditional probabilities were fine-tuned on a training set of 86 patients (mean age, 49 years 6 16 [standard deviation]; 53 women). Accuracy was compared with radiology residents, general radiologists, neuroradiology fellows, and academic neuroradiologists by using accuracy of top one, top two, and top three differential diagnoses in 92 independent test set patients (mean age, 47 years 6 18; 52 women). Results:  For accuracy of top three differential diagnoses, the AI system (91% correct) performed similarly to academic neuroradiologists (86% correct; P = .20), and better than radiology residents (56%; P , .001), general radiologists (57%; P , .001), and neuroradiology fellows (77%; P = .003). The performance of the AI system was not affected by disease prevalence (93% accuracy for common vs 85% for rare diseases; P = .26). Radiologists were more accurate at diagnosing common versus rare diagnoses (78% vs 47% across all radiologists; P , .001). Conclusion:  An artificial intelligence system for brain MRI approached overall top one, top two, and top three differential diagnoses accuracy of neuroradiologists and exceeded that of less-specialized radiologists.","2020-06","2022-12-01 00:41:29","2022-12-01 00:41:29","2022-12-01 00:41:29","626-637","","3","295","","Radiology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/NMMVB9Y6/Rauschecker et al. - 2020 - Artificial Intelligence System Approaching Neurora.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and Methods:  In this retrospective study, spatial autoencoders with skip-connections (which can learn to compress and reconstruct data) were leveraged to learn the normal variability of the brain from MR scans of healthy individuals. A total of 100 normal, in-house MR scans were used for training. Subsequently, as the model was unable to reconstruct anomalies well, this characteristic was exploited for detecting and delineating various diseases by computing the difference between the input data and their reconstruction. The unsupervised model was compared with a supervised U-Net– and threshold-based classifier trained on data from 50 patients with multiple sclerosis (in-house dataset) and 50 patients from The Cancer Imaging Archive. Both the unsupervised and supervised U-Net models were tested on five different datasets containing MR images of microangiopathy, glioblastoma, and multiple sclerosis. Precisionrecall statistics and derivations thereof (mean area under the precision-recall curve, Dice score) were used to quantify lesion detection and segmentation performance. Results:  The unsupervised approach outperformed the naive thresholding approach in lesion detection (mean F1 scores ranging from 17% to 62% vs 6.4% to 15% across the five different datasets) and performed similarly to the supervised U-Net (20%–64%) across a variety of pathologic conditions. This outperformance was mostly driven by improved precision compared with the thresholding approach (mean precisions, 15%–59% vs 3.4%–10%).

We conducted an extensive literature search on the available scientific evidence of these products. Articles were classified according to a hierarchical model of efficacy. Results The overview included 100 CE-marked AI products from 54 different vendors. For 64/100 products, there was no peerreviewed evidence of its efficacy.

In order to diagnose MS, multiple screening methods have been proposed so far; among them, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has received considerable attention among physicians. MRI modalities provide physicians with fundamental information about the struc­ ture and function of the brain, which is crucial for the rapid diagnosis of MS lesions. Diagnosing MS using MRI is time-consuming, tedious, and prone to manual errors. Research on the implementation of computer aided diagnosis system (CADS) based on artificial intelligence (AI) to diagnose MS involves conventional machine learning and deep learning (DL) methods. In conventional machine learning, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification steps are carried out by using trial and error; on the contrary, these steps in DL are based on deep layers whose values are automatically learn. In this paper, a complete review of automated MS diagnosis methods performed using DL techniques with MRI neuroimaging modalities is provided. Initially, the steps involved in various CADS proposed using MRI modalities and DL techniques for MS diagnosis are investigated. The important preprocessing techniques employed in various works are analyzed. Most of the published papers on MS diagnosis using MRI modalities and DL are presented.

We aimed to evaluate machine learning models for disability prediction on the basis of radiomic, volumetric, and connectivity features derived from routine brain MR images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 3T brain MR imaging studies of patients with multiple sclerosis, including 3D T1-weighted and T2-weighted FLAIR sequences, were selected from 2 institutions. T1-weighted images were processed to obtain volume, connectivity score (inferred from the T2 lesion location), and texture features for an atlas-based set of GM regions. The site 1 cohort was randomly split into training (n ¼ 400) and test (n ¼ 100) sets, while the site 2 cohort (n ¼ 104) constituted the external test set. After feature selection of clinicodemographic and MR imaging–derived variables, different machine learning algorithms predicting disability as measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale were trained and crossvalidated on the training cohort and evaluated on the test sets. The effect of different algorithms on model performance was tested using the 1-way repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: The selection procedure identiﬁed the 9 most informative variables, including age and secondary-progressive course and a subset of radiomic features extracted from the prefrontal cortex, subcortical GM, and cerebellum. The machine learning models predicted disability with high accuracy (r approaching 0.80) and excellent intra- and intersite generalizability (r $ 0.73). The machine learning algorithm had no relevant effect on the performance. CONCLUSIONS: The multidimensional analysis of brain MR images, including radiomic features and clinicodemographic data, is highly informative of the clinical status of patients with multiple sclerosis, representing a promising approach to bridge the gap between conventional imaging and disability.","2021-11","2022-12-01 17:24:36","2023-01-28 16:18:43","2022-12-01 17:24:36","1927-1933","","11","42","","AJNR Am J                 Neuroradiol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/JLKU84QA/Pontillo et al. - 2021 - A Combined Radiomics and Machine Learning Approach.pdf","","Read","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early diagnosis of MS is highly desirable as treatments are more effective in preventing MS-related disability when given in the early stages of the disease. The main aim of this research is to predict the occurrence of a second MS-related clinical event, which indicates the conversion of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) to clinically definite MS (CDMS). In this study, we apply a branch of artificial intelligence known as deep learning and develop a fully automated algorithm primed with convolutional neural network (CNN) that has the ability to learn from MRI scan features. The basic architecture of our algorithm is that of the VGG16 CNN model, but amended such that it can handle MRI DICOM images. A dataset comprised of scans acquired using two different scanners was used for the purposes of verification of the algorithm. A group of 49 patients had volumetric MRI scans taken at onset of the disease and then again one year later using one of the two scanners. In total, this yielded 7360 images which were then used for training, validation, and testing of the algorithm. Initially, these raw images were taken through 4 steps of preprocessing. In order to boost the efficiency of the process, we pretrained our algorithm using the publicly available ADNI dataset used to classify Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, we used our preprocessed dataset to train and test the algorithm. Clinical evaluation conducted a year after the first time point revealed that 26 of the 49 patients had converted to CDMS, while the remaining 23 had not. Results of testing showed that our algorithm was able to predict the clinical results with an accuracy of 88.8% and with an area under the curve (AUC) of 91%. A highly accurate algorithm was developed using CNN approach to reliably predict conversion of patients with CIS to CDMS using MRI data from two different scanners.","2022-07-15","2022-12-01 17:24:39","2023-01-28 02:12:11","2022-12-01 17:24:39","1-8","","","2022","","Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/SRGJSXVU/Afzal et al. - 2022 - Prediction of Conversion from CIS to Clinically De.pdf","","Read","","Koundal, Deepika","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and Methods: For this retrospective analysis, 100 MS patients (65 female, 37 [22–68] years) were randomly selected from a prospective observational cohort between 2014 and 2016. In a subset of 50 patients, an artificial neural network (DiamondGAN) was trained to generate a synthetic DIR (synthDIR) from standard acquisitions (T1, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR]). With the resulting network, synthDIR was generated for the remaining 50 subjects. These images as well as conventionally acquired DIR (trueDIR) and FLAIR images were assessed for MS lesions by 2 independent readers, blinded to the source of the DIR image. Lesion counts in the different modalities were compared using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and interrater analysis was performed. Contrast-to-noise ratios were compared for objective image quality. Results: Utilization of synthDIR allowed to detect significantly more lesions compared with the use of FLAIR images (31.4 ± 20.7 vs 22.8 ± 12.7, P < 0.001). This improvement was mainly attributable to an improved depiction of juxtacortical lesions (12.3 ± 10.8 vs 7.2 ± 5.6, P < 0.001). Interrater reliability was excellent in FLAIR 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85–0.95), synthDIR 0.93 (95% CI, 0.87–0.96), and trueDIR 0.95 (95% CI, 0.85–0.98). Contrast-to-noise ratio in synthDIR exceeded that of FLAIR (22.0 ± 6.4 vs 16.7 ± 3.6, P = 0.009); no significant difference was seen in comparison to trueDIR (22.0 ± 6.4 vs 22.4 ± 7.9, P = 0.87). Conclusions: Computationally generated DIR images improve lesion depiction compared with the use of standard modalities. This method demonstrates how artificial intelligence can help improving imaging in specific pathologies.","2020-05","2022-12-01 17:24:44","2022-12-01 17:24:44","2022-12-01 17:24:44","318-323","","5","55","","Investigative Radiology","Deep-Learning Generated Synthetic Double Inversion Recovery Images Improve Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Detection","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/NNS7B4C9/Finck et al. - 2020 - Deep-Learning Generated Synthetic Double Inversion.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: We acquired fast 3D T1w BRAVO and fast 3D T2w FLAIR MRI sequences (half the phase encodes and half the number of slices) in parallel to conventional parameters. Using a subset of the scans, we trained a DL model to generate images from fast scans with quality similar to the conventional scans and then applied the model to the remaining scans. We calculated clinically relevant T1w volumetrics (normalized whole brain, thalamic, gray matter, and white matter volume) for all scans and T2 lesion volume in a sub-analysis. We performed paired t-tests comparing conventional, fast, and fast with DL for these volumetrics, and ﬁt repeated measures mixed-effects models to test for differences in correlations between volumetrics and clinically relevant patient-reported outcomes (PRO). Results: We found statistically signiﬁcant but small differences between conventional and fast scans with DL for all T1w volumetrics.

We developed a supervised machine learning algorithm, DeepnCCA, for corpus callosum segmentation and relate callosal morphology to clinical disability using conventional MRI scans collected in clinical routine. Methods: In a prospective study of 553 MS patients with 704 acquisitions, 200 unique 2D T2-weighted MRI scans were delineated to develop, train, and validate DeepnCCA. Comparative FreeSurfer segmentations were obtained in 504 3D T1-weighted scans. Both FreeSurfer and DeepnCCA outputs were correlated with clinical disability. Using principal component analysis of the DeepnCCA output, the morphological changes were explored in relation to clinical disease burden. Results: DeepnCCA and manual segmentations had high similarity (Dice coefﬁcients 98.1±.11%, 89.3±.76%, for intracranial and corpus callosum area, respectively through 10-fold cross-validation). DeepnCCA had numerically stronger correlations with cognitive and physical disability as compared to FreeSurfer: Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) ±6 months (r = –.22 P = .002; r = –.17, P = .013), future EDSS (r = –.26, P<.001; r = –.17, P = .012), and future symbol digit modalities test (r = .26, P = .001; r = .24, P = .003). The corpus callosum became thinner with increasing cognitive and physical disability. Increasing physical disability, additionally, signiﬁcantly correlated with a more angled corpus callosum. Conclusions: DeepnCCA (https://github.com/plattenmichael/DeepnCCA/) is an openly available tool that can provide fast and accurate corpus callosum measurements applicable to large MS cohorts, potentially suitable for monitoring disease progression and therapy response.","2021-05","2022-12-01 17:24:47","2022-12-01 17:24:47","2022-12-01 17:24:47","493-500","","3","31","","Journal of Neuroimaging","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/B2UAEJAQ/Platten et al. - 2021 - Deep Learning Corpus Callosum Segmentation as a Ne.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, embase and computers and applied sciences complete databases. Relevant papers included “machine learning” or “artificial intelligence” and the autoimmune diseases search term(s) in their title, abstract or key words. Exclusion criteria: studies not written in English, no real human patient data included, publication prior to 2001, studies that were not peer reviewed, non-autoimmune disease comorbidity research and review papers. 169 (of 702) studies met the criteria for inclusion. Support vector machines and random forests were the most popular ML methods used. ML models using data on multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease were most common. A small proportion of studies (7.7% or 13/169) combined different data types in the modelling process. Cross-validation, combined with a separate testing set for more robust model evaluation occurred in 8.3% of papers (14/169). The field may benefit from adopting a best practice of validation, cross-validation and independent testing of ML models. Many models achieved good predictive results in simple scenarios (e.g. classification of cases and controls).

Adoption of standards such as Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, and the Checklist for Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Medical Imaging is increasing to improve the peer-review process and reporting of AI tools. However, no such standards exist for product-level review. Methods: A review of clinical trials showed a paucity of evidence for radiology AI products; thus, the authors developed a 10-question assessment tool for reviewing AI products with an emphasis on their validation and result dissemination. The assessment tool was applied to commercial and open-source algorithms used for diagnosis to extract evidence on the clinical utility of the tools. Results: There is limited technical information on methodologies for FDA-approved algorithms compared with open-source products, likely because of intellectual property concerns. Furthermore, FDA-approved products use much smaller data sets compared with opensource AI tools, because the terms of use of public data sets are limited to academic and noncommercial entities, which precludes their use in commercial products. Conclusions: Overall, this study reveals a broad spectrum of maturity and clinical use of AI products, but a large gap exists in exploring actual performance of AI tools in clinical practice.","2020-11","2022-12-01 17:24:52","2022-12-01 17:24:52","2022-12-01 17:24:52","1371-1381","","11","17","","Journal of the American College of Radiology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/FH5SJP2U/Tariq et al. - 2020 - Current Clinical Applications of Artificial Intell.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning techniques may offer more powerful means to predict disease course in MS patients. In our study, 724 patients from the Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation in MS at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (CLIMB study) and 400 patients from the EPIC dataset, University of California, San Francisco, were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was an increase in               Expanded Disability Status Scale               (               EDSS               ) ≥ 1.5 (worsening) or not (non-worsening) at up to 5 years after the baseline visit. Classification models were built using the CLIMB dataset with patients’ clinical and MRI longitudinal observations in first 2 years, and further validated using the EPIC dataset. We compared the performance of three popular machine learning algorithms (               SVM, Logistic Regression,               and               Random Forest               ) and three ensemble learning approaches (               XGBoost, LightGBM               , and a Meta-learner               L               ). A “threshold” was established to trade-off the performance between the two classes. Predictive features were identified and compared among different models. Machine learning models achieved 0.79 and 0.83 AUC scores for the CLIMB and EPIC datasets, respectively, shortly after disease onset. Ensemble learning methods were more effective and robust compared to standalone algorithms. Two ensemble models, XGBoost and LightGBM were superior to the other four models evaluated in our study.

Nowadays, there is a lack of comprehensive predictive models of response to individual treatment.This paper arises from the clinical need to improve this situation. To achieve it, all patient's information was used to evaluate the effectiveness of demographic, clinical and paraclinical variables of individual response to fourteen disease-modifying therapies in MSBase, an international cohort. A personalized prediction model to three stages of disease, as a support tool in clinical decision making for each MS patient, was developed applying machine learning and Big Data techniques. These techniques were also used to reduce the data set and define a minimum set of characteristics for each patient. Best predictors for the response to treatment were identified to refine the predictive model. Fourteen relevant variables were selected.

However, cortical lesions are hardly visible in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T, and thus their automated detection has been so far little explored. In this study, we propose a fully-convolutional deep learning approach, based on the 3D U-Net, for the automated segmentation of cortical and white matter lesions at 3T. For this purpose, we consider a clinically plausible MRI setting consisting of two MRI contrasts only: one conventional T2-weighted sequence (FLAIR), and one specialized T1-weighted sequence (MP2RAGE). We include 90 patients from two different centers with a total of 728 and 3856 gray and white matter lesions, respectively. We show that two reference methods developed for white matter lesion segmentation are inadequate to detect small cortical lesions, whereas our proposed framework is able to achieve a detection rate of 76% for both cortical and white matter lesions with a false positive rate of 29% in comparison to manual segmentation.

Estimating lesion age is an important step when studying the longitudinal behavior of MS lesions and can be used in applications such as studying the temporal dynamics of chronic active MS lesions. Our lesion age estimation models use first order radiomic features over a lesion derived from conventional T1 (T1w) and T2 weighted (T2w) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T1w with gadolinium contrast (T1w+c), and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) MRI sequences as well as demographic information.

A one or two step random forest model for lesion age is fit on a training set using a lesion volume cutoff of 15 mm3 or 50 mm3. We explore the performance of nine different modeling scenarios that included various combinations of the MRI sequences and demographic information and a one or two step random forest models, as well as simpler models that only uses the mean radiomic feature from each MRI sequence. The best performing model on a validation set is a model that uses a two-step random forest model on the radiomic features from all of the MRI sequences with demographic information using a lesion volume cutoff of 50 mm3. This model has a mean absolute error of 7.23 months (95% CI: [6.98, 13.43]) and a median absolute error of 5.98 months (95% CI: [5.26, 13.25]) in the validation set.

Purpose To evaluate whether deep learning can predict enhancing lesions on MRI scans obtained without the use of contrast material. Materials and Methods This study involved prospective analysis of existing MRI data. A convolutional neural network was used for classification of enhancing lesions on unenhanced MRI scans. This classification was performed for each slice, and the slice scores were combined by using a fully connected network to produce participant-wise predictions. The network input consisted of 1970 multiparametric MRI scans from 1008 patients recruited from 2005 to 2009. Enhanced lesions on postcontrast T1-weighted images served as the ground truth. The network performance was assessed by using fivefold cross-validation. Statistical analysis of the network performance included calculation of lesion detection rates and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs). Results MRI scans from 1008 participants (mean age, 37.7 years ± 9.7; 730 women) were analyzed. At least one enhancing lesion was observed in 519 participants.

Clinical","","2213-1582","10.1016/j.nicl.2019.102003","","Machine learning-based imaging diagnostics has recently reached or even surpassed the level of clinical experts in several clinical domains. However, classification decisions of a trained machine learning system are typically non-transparent, a major hindrance for clinical integration, error tracking or knowledge discovery. In this study, we present a transparent deep learning framework relying on 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS), the most widespread autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease. MS is commonly diagnosed utilizing a combination of clinical presentation and conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), specifically the occurrence and presentation of white matter lesions in T2-weighted images. We hypothesized that using LRP in a naive predictive model would enable us to uncover relevant image features that a trained CNN uses for decision-making. Since imaging markers in MS are well-established this would enable us to validate the respective CNN model. First, we pre-trained a CNN on MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 921), afterwards specializing the CNN to discriminate between MS patients (n = 76) and healthy controls (n = 71). Using LRP, we then produced a heatmap for each subject in the holdout set depicting the voxel-wise relevance for a particular classification decision. The resulting CNN model resulted in a balanced accuracy of 87.04% and an area under the curve of 96.08% in a receiver operating characteristic curve. The subsequent LRP visualization revealed that the CNN model focuses indeed on individual lesions, but also incorporates additional information such as lesion location, non-lesional white matter or gray matter areas such as the thalamus, which are established conventional and advanced MRI markers in MS. We conclude that LRP and the proposed framework have the capability to make diagnostic decisions of CNN models transparent, which could serve to justify classification decisions for clinical review, verify diagnosis-relevant features and potentially gather new disease knowledge.","2019","2023-01-31 00:41:12","2023-01-31 00:41:34","","102003","","","24","","Neuroimage Clin","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31634822 PMCID: PMC6807560","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/CT6QH9VU/Eitel et al. - 2019 - Uncovering convolutional neural network decisions .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634822","NAIMS-AIMS member","Adult; Convolutional neural networks deep learning multiple sclerosis MRI; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Layer-wise relevance propagation; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Sclerosis; Neuroimaging; Visualization transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD) values from SWM bundles across the cortex and major deep white matter (DWM) tracts were extracted from 29 early MS patients and 31 age- and sex-matched HC. Thickness of 68 cortical regions and resting-state functional-connectivity (RSFC) among them were calculated. The distribution of structural and functional metrics between groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Utilizing a machine learning method (adaptive boosting), 6 models were built based on: 1-SWM, 2-DWM, 3-SWM and DWM, 4-cortical thickness, or 5-RSFC measures. In model 6, all features from previous models were incorporated. The models were trained with nested 5-folds cross-validation. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCroc ) values were calculated to evaluate classification performance of each model. Permutation tests were used to compare the AUCroc values. RESULTS: Patients had higher MD in SWM bundles including insula, inferior frontal, orbitofrontal, superior and medial temporal, and pre- and post-central cortices (p < .05). No group differences were found for any other MRI metric. The model incorporating SWM and DWM features provided the best classification (AUCroc = 0.75). The SWM model provided higher AUCroc (0.74), compared to DWM (0.63), cortical thickness (0.67), RSFC (0.63), and all-features (0.68) models (p < .001 for all). CONCLUSION: Our results reveal a non-random pattern of SWM abnormalities at early stages of MS even before pronounced structural and functional alterations emerge.","2022-01","2023-01-31 00:43:20","2023-01-31 00:43:40","","36-47","","1","32","","J Neuroimaging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34532924 PMCID: PMC8752496","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/INEFFYWU/Buyukturkoglu et al. - 2022 - Machine learning to investigate superficial white .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34532924","NAIMS-AIMS member","Anisotropy; diffusion tensor imaging; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Humans; machine learning; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; multiple sclerosis; Multiple Sclerosis; superficial white matter; u-fibers; White Matter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been shown that even when care is taken to standardize acquisitions, any changes in hardware, software, or protocol design can lead to differences in quantitative results. This greatly impacts the quantitative utility of MRI in multi-site or long-term studies, where consistency is often valued over image quality. We propose a method of contrast harmonization, called DeepHarmony, which uses a U-Net-based deep learning architecture to produce images with consistent contrast. To provide training data, a small overlap cohort (n = 8) was scanned using two different protocols. Images harmonized with DeepHarmony showed significant improvement in consistency of volume quantification between scanning protocols. A longitudinal MRI dataset of patients with multiple sclerosis was also used to evaluate the effect of a protocol change on atrophy calculations in a clinical research setting. The results show that atrophy calculations were substantially and significantly affected by protocol change, whereas such changes have a less significant effect and substantially reduced overall difference when using DeepHarmony. This establishes that DeepHarmony can be used with an overlap cohort to reduce inconsistencies in segmentation caused by changes in scanner protocol, allowing for modernization of hardware and protocol design in long-term studies without invalidating previously acquired data.","2019-12-01","2023-01-31 00:44:42","2023-01-31 00:44:58","2023-01-31 00:44:42","160-170","","","64","","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","DeepHarmony","Artificial Intelligence in MRI","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/ZA6H3R9X/Dewey et al. - 2019 - DeepHarmony A deep learning approach to contrast .pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/TZ4VGSZQ/S0730725X18306490.html","","NAIMS-AIMS member","Contrast harmonization; Deep learning; Magnetic resonance imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, conventional biomarkers only moderately correlate with MS disease progression. Recently, some MS lesional imaging biomarkers such as cortical lesions (CL), the central vein sign (CVS), and paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), visible in specialized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, have shown higher specificity in differential diagnosis. Moreover, studies have shown that CL and PRL are potential prognostic biomarkers, the former correlating with cognitive impairments and the latter with early disability progression. As machine learning-based methods have achieved extraordinary performance in the assessment of conventional imaging biomarkers, such as white matter lesion segmentation, several automated or semi-automated methods have been proposed as well for CL, PRL, and CVS. In the present review, we first introduce these MS biomarkers and their imaging methods. Subsequently, we describe the corresponding machine learning-based methods that were proposed to tackle these clinical questions, putting them into context with respect to the challenges they are facing, including non-standardized MRI protocols, limited datasets, and moderate inter-rater variability.

Although focal lesions are the most visible signs of MS pathology on conventional MRI, it has been shown that even tissues that appear normal may exhibit decreased myelin content as revealed by myelin-specific images (i.e., myelin maps). Current methods for analyzing myelin maps typically use global or regional mean myelin measurements to detect abnormalities, but ignore finer spatial patterns that may be characteristic of MS. In this paper, we present a machine learning method to automatically learn, from multimodal MR images, latent spatial features that can potentially improve the detection of MS pathology at early stage. More specifically, 3D image patches are extracted from myelin maps and the corresponding T1-weighted (T1w) MRIs, and are used to learn a latent joint myelin-T1w feature representation via unsupervised deep learning. Using a data set of images from MS patients and healthy controls, a common set of patches are selected via a voxel-wise t-test performed between the two groups. In each MS image, any patches overlapping with focal lesions are excluded, and a feature imputation method is used to fill in the missing values. A feature selection process (LASSO) is then utilized to construct a sparse representation. The resulting normal-appearing features are used to train a random forest classifier. Using the myelin and T1w images of 55 relapse-remitting MS patients and 44 healthy controls in an 11-fold cross-validation experiment, the proposed method achieved an average classification accuracy of 87.9% (SD=8.4%), which is higher and more consistent across folds than those attained by regional mean myelin (73.7%, SD=13.7%) and T1w measurements (66.7%, SD=10.6%), or deep-learned features in either the myelin (83.8%, SD=11.0%) or T1w (70.1%, SD=13.6%) images alone, suggesting that the proposed method has strong potential for identifying image features that are more sensitive and specific to MS pathology in normal-appearing brain tissues.","2018-01-01","2023-01-31 00:48:15","2023-01-31 00:48:46","2023-01-31 00:48:15","169-178","","","17","","NeuroImage: Clinical","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/8SMJ2HY3/Yoo et al. - 2018 - Deep learning of joint myelin and T1w MRI features.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/U245ULM3/S2213158217302553.html","","NAIMS-AIMS member","Deep learning; Machine learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Multiple sclerosis; Myelin water imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Segmentation of the spinal cord and lesions from MRI data provides measures of damage, which are key criteria for the diagnosis, prognosis, and longitudinal monitoring in MS. Automating this operation eliminates inter-rater variability and increases the efficiency of large-throughput analysis pipelines. Robust and reliable segmentation across multi-site spinal cord data is challenging because of the large variability related to acquisition parameters and image artifacts. In particular, a precise delineation of lesions is hindered by a broad heterogeneity of lesion contrast, size, location, and shape. The goal of this study was to develop a fully-automatic framework — robust to variability in both image parameters and clinical condition — for segmentation of the spinal cord and intramedullary MS lesions from conventional MRI data of MS and non-MS cases. Scans of 1042 subjects (459 healthy controls, 471 MS patients, and 112 with other spinal pathologies) were included in this multi-site study (n = 30). Data spanned three contrasts (T1-, T2-, and T2∗-weighted) for a total of 1943 vol and featured large heterogeneity in terms of resolution, orientation, coverage, and clinical conditions. The proposed cord and lesion automatic segmentation approach is based on a sequence of two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To deal with the very small proportion of spinal cord and/or lesion voxels compared to the rest of the volume, a first CNN with 2D dilated convolutions detects the spinal cord centerline, followed by a second CNN with 3D convolutions that segments the spinal cord and/or lesions. CNNs were trained independently with the Dice loss. When compared against manual segmentation, our CNN-based approach showed a median Dice of 95% vs. 88% for PropSeg (p ≤ 0.05), a state-of-the-art spinal cord segmentation method. Regarding lesion segmentation on MS data, our framework provided a Dice of 60%, a relative volume difference of −15%, and a lesion-wise detection sensitivity and precision of 83% and 77%, respectively. In this study, we introduce a robust method to segment the spinal cord and intramedullary MS lesions on a variety of MRI contrasts. The proposed framework is open-source and readily available in the Spinal Cord Toolbox.","2019-01-01","2023-01-31 00:49:45","2023-01-31 00:50:11","2023-01-31 00:49:45","901-915","","","184","","NeuroImage","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/URCLKNCV/Gros et al. - 2019 - Automatic segmentation of the spinal cord and intr.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/ZEYDEQXN/S1053811918319578.html","","NAIMS-AIMS member","Convolutional neural networks; MRI; Multiple sclerosis; Segmentation; Spinal cord","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, acquiring such images takes a long time, which is both costly and susceptible to motion artifacts. Acquiring MR images with good in-plane resolution and poor through-plane resolution is a common strategy that saves imaging time, preserves SNR, and provides one viewpoint with good resolution in two directions. Unfortunately, this strategy also creates orthogonal viewpoints that have poor resolution in one direction and, for 2D MR acquisition protocols, also creates aliasing artifacts. A deep learning approach called SMORE that carries out both anti-aliasing and super-resolution on these types of acquisitions using no external atlas or exemplars has been previously reported but not extensively validated. This paper reviews the SMORE algorithm and then demonstrates its performance in four applications with the goal to demonstrate its potential for use in both research and clinical scenarios. It is first shown to improve the visualization of brain white matter lesions in FLAIR images acquired from multiple sclerosis patients. Then it is shown to improve the visualization of scarring in cardiac left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. Third, its performance on multi-view images of the tongue is demonstrated and finally it is shown to improve performance in parcellation of the brain ventricular system.

Patients featuring a higher paramagnetic rim lesion burden tend to have more aggressive disease. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture (RimNet) for automated detection of paramagnetic rim lesions in MS employing multiple magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrasts. Materials and methods Imaging data were acquired at 3 Tesla on three different scanners from two different centers, totaling 124 MS patients, and studied retrospectively. Paramagnetic rim lesion detection was independently assessed by two expert raters on T2*-phase images, yielding 462 rim-positive (rim+) and 4857 rim-negative (rim-) lesions. RimNet was designed using 3D patches centered on candidate lesions in 3D-EPI phase and 3D FLAIR as input to two network branches. The interconnection of branches at both the first network blocks and the last fully connected layers favors the extraction of low and high-level multimodal features, respectively. RimNet’s performance was quantitatively evaluated against experts’ evaluation from both lesion-wise and patient-wise perspectives. For the latter, patients were categorized based on a clinically relevant threshold of 4 rim+ lesions per patient. The individual prediction capabilities of the images were also explored and compared (DeLong test) by testing a CNN trained with one image as input (unimodal). Results The unimodal exploration showed the superior performance of 3D-EPI phase and 3D-EPI magnitude images in the rim+/- classification task (AUC = 0.913 and 0.901), compared to the 3D FLAIR (AUC = 0.855, Ps < 0.0001). The proposed multimodal RimNet prototype clearly outperformed the best unimodal approach (AUC = 0.943, P < 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity achieved by RimNet (70.6% and 94.9%, respectively) are comparable to those of experts at the lesion level. In the patient-wise analysis, RimNet performed with an accuracy of 89.5% and a Dice coefficient (or F1 score) of 83.5%. Conclusions The proposed prototype showed promising performance, supporting the usage of RimNet for speeding up and standardizing the paramagnetic rim lesions analysis in MS.","2020-01-01","2023-01-31 01:32:47","2023-01-31 01:32:47","2023-01-31 01:32:47","102412","","","28","","NeuroImage: Clinical","RimNet","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/X7ABXKKF/Barquero et al. - 2020 - RimNet A deep 3D multimodal MRI architecture for .pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/KJVLCF96/S2213158220302497.html","","","Deep learning; Multimodal network; Multiple sclerosis; Paramagnetic rim lesions; Supervised classification; Susceptibility-based MRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accurate MRI assessment of PML lesion burden and brain parenchymal atrophy is of decisive value in monitoring the disease course and response to therapy. However, there are currently no validated automatic methods for quantification of PML lesion burden or associated parenchymal volume loss. Furthermore, manual brain or lesion delineations can be tedious, require the use of valuable time resources by radiologists or trained experts, and are often subjective. In this work, we introduce JCnet (named after the causative viral agent), an end-to-end, fully automated method for brain parenchymal and lesion segmentation in PML using consecutive 3D patch-based convolutional neural networks. The network architecture consists of multi-view feature pyramid networks with hierarchical residual learning blocks containing embedded batch normalization and nonlinear activation functions. The feature maps across the bottom-up and top-down pathways of the feature pyramids are merged, and an output probability membership generated through convolutional pathways, thus rendering the method fully convolutional. Our results show that this approach outperforms and improves longitudinal consistency compared to conventional, state-of-the-art methods of healthy brain and multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation, utilized here as comparators given the lack of available methods validated for use in PML. The ability to produce robust and accurate automated measures of brain atrophy and lesion segmentation in PML is not only valuable clinically but holds promise toward including standardized quantitative MRI measures in clinical trials of targeted therapies.

Our automated rim + detection algorithm, QSMRim-Net, consists of a two-branch feature extraction network and a synthetic minority oversampling network to classify rim + lesions. The first network branch is for image feature extraction from the QSM and T2-FLAIR, and the second network branch is a fully connected network for QSM lesion-level radiomic feature extraction. The oversampling network is designed to increase classification performance with imbalanced data. Results On a lesion-level, in a five-fold cross validation framework, the proposed QSMRim-Net detected rim + lesions with a partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (pROC AUC) of 0.760, where clinically relevant false positive rates of less than 0.1 were considered. The method attained an area under the precision recall curve (PR AUC) of 0.704. QSMRim-Net out-performed other state-of-the-art methods applied to the QSM on both pROC AUC and PR AUC. On a subject-level, comparing the predicted rim + lesion count and the human expert annotated count, QSMRim-Net achieved the lowest mean square error of 0.98 and the highest correlation of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.92). Conclusion This study develops a novel automated deep neural network for rim + MS lesion identification using T2-FLAIR and QSM images.","2022-01-01","2023-01-31 01:42:00","2023-01-31 01:42:13","2023-01-31 01:42:00","102979","","","34","","NeuroImage: Clinical","QSMRim-Net","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/X3X7TNRD/Zhang et al. - 2022 - QSMRim-Net Imbalance-aware learning for identific.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/5QHJAPZK/S2213158222000444.html","","NAIMS-AIMS member","Chronic active lesions; Convolutional neural network; Multiple sclerosis; Quantitative susceptibility mapping; Radiomic features","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to develop a fast, automated method for assessing rescan need in motion-corrupted brain series. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A deep learning–based approach was developed, outputting a probability for a series to be clinically useful. Comparison of this per-series probability with a threshold, which can depend on scan indication and reading radiologist, determines whether a series needs to be rescanned. The deep learning classification performance was compared with that of 4 technologists and 5 radiologists in 49 test series with low and moderate motion artifacts. These series were assumed to be scanned for 2 scan indications: screening for multiple sclerosis and stroke. RESULTS: The image-quality rating was found to be scan indication– and reading radiologist–dependent. Of the 49 test datasets, technologists created a mean ratio of rescans/recalls of (4.7 ± 5.1)/(9.5 ± 6.8) for MS and (8.6 ± 7.7)/(1.6 ± 1.9) for stroke. With thresholds adapted for scan indication and reading radiologist, deep learning created a rescan/recall ratio of (7.3 ± 2.2)/(3.2 ± 2.5) for MS, and (3.6 ± 1.5)/(2.8 ± 1.6) for stroke. Due to the large variability in the technologists' assessments, it was only the decrease in the recall rate for MS, for which the deep learning algorithm was trained, that was statistically significant (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Fast, automated deep learning–based image-quality rating can decrease rescan and recall rates, while rendering them technologist-independent. It was estimated that decreasing rescans and recalls from the technologists' values to the values of deep learning could save hospitals $24,000/scanner/year.","2019-02-01","2023-01-31 01:43:12","2023-01-31 01:43:12","2023-01-31 01:43:12","217-223","","2","40","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 by American Journal of Neuroradiology","","","","www.ajnr.org","","Publisher: American Journal of Neuroradiology Section: Adult Brain PMID: 30606726","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/NTZSPKB6/Sreekumari et al. - 2019 - A Deep Learning–Based Approach to Reduce Rescan an.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606726","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, an individual state of the art strategy, with precise adjustment to the patient’s characteristics, is still far from being part of the everyday care of pwMS. The development of digital twins could decisively advance the necessary implementation of an individualized innovative management of MS. Through artificial intelligence-based analysis of several disease parameters – including clinical and para-clinical outcomes, multi-omics, biomarkers, patient-related data, information about the patient’s life circumstances and plans, and medical procedures – a digital twin paired to the patient’s characteristic can be created, enabling healthcare professionals to handle large amounts of patient data. This can contribute to a more personalized and effective care by integrating data from multiple sources in a standardized manner, implementing individualized clinical pathways, supporting physician-patient communication and facilitating a shared decision-making. With a clear display of pre-analyzed patient data on a dashboard, patient participation and individualized clinical decisions as well as the prediction of disease progression and treatment simulation could become possible. In this review, we focus on the advantages, challenges and practical aspects of digital twins in the management of MS. We discuss the use of digital twins for MS as a revolutionary tool to improve diagnosis, monitoring and therapy refining patients’ well-being, saving economic costs, and enabling prevention of disease progression.

Purpose To reduce gadolinium dose in contrast-enhanced brain MRI using a deep learning method. Study type Retrospective, crossover. Population Sixty patients receiving clinically indicated contrast-enhanced brain MRI. Sequence 3D T1-weighted inversion-recovery prepped fast-spoiled-gradient-echo (IR-FSPGR) imaging was acquired at both 1.5T and 3T. In 60 brain MRI exams, the IR-FSPGR sequence was obtained under three conditions: precontrast, postcontrast images with 10% low-dose (0.01mmol/kg) and 100% full-dose (0.1 mmol/kg) of gadobenate dimeglumine. We trained a deep learning model using the first 10 cases (with mixed indications) to approximate full-dose images from the precontrast and low-dose images. Synthesized full-dose images were created using the trained model in two test sets: 20 patients with mixed indications and 30 patients with glioma. Assessment For both test sets, low-dose, true full-dose, and the synthesized full-dose postcontrast image sets were compared quantitatively using peak-signal-to-noise-ratios (PSNR) and structural-similarity-index (SSIM). For the test set comprised of 20 patients with mixed indications, two neuroradiologists scored blindly and independently for the three postcontrast image sets, evaluating image quality, motion-artifact suppression, and contrast enhancement compared with precontrast images. Statistical Analysis Results were assessed using paired t-tests and noninferiority tests. Results The proposed deep learning method yielded significant (n = 50, P < 0.001) improvements over the low-dose images (>5 dB PSNR gains and >11.0% SSIM). Ratings on image quality (n = 20, P = 0.003) and contrast enhancement (n = 20, P < 0.001) were significantly increased. Compared to true full-dose images, the synthesized full-dose images have a slight but not significant reduction in image quality (n = 20, P = 0.083) and contrast enhancement (n = 20, P = 0.068). Slightly better (n = 20, P = 0.039) motion-artifact suppression was noted in the synthesized images. The noninferiority test rejects the inferiority of the synthesized to true full-dose images for image quality (95% CI: –14–9%), artifacts suppression (95% CI: –5–20%), and contrast enhancement (95% CI: –13–6%).

However, supervised machine learning requires reliable labelled data, which is is often difficult or impossible to collect or at least time consuming and thereby costly. Therefore methods requiring only partly labeled data (semi-supervised) or no labeling at all (unsupervised methods) have been applied more regularly. Anomaly detection is one possible methodology that is able to leverage semi-supervised and unsupervised methods to handle medical imaging tasks like classification and segmentation. This paper uses a semi-exhaustive literature review of relevant anomaly detection papers in medical imaging to cluster into applications, highlight important results, establish lessons learned and give further advice on how to approach anomaly detection in medical imaging. The qualitative analysis is based on google scholar and 4 different search terms, resulting in 120 different analysed papers. The main results showed that the current research is mostly motivated by reducing the need for labelled data. Also, the successful and substantial amount of research in the brain MRI domain shows the potential for applications in further domains like OCT and chest X-ray.","2022","2023-02-03 01:14:44","2023-02-03 01:14:44","2023-02-03 01:14:44","33-38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-658-36295-9_5 arXiv:2108.11986 [cs, eess]","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/DYNKVFML/Tschuchnig and Gadermayr - 2022 - Anomaly Detection in Medical Imaging -- A Mini Rev.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/8NYVK8TB/2108.html","","","Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Image and Video Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The correct interpretation of these data requires excellent clinical expertise and experience. Deep neural networks aim to assist clinicians in identifying MS using imaging data. However, before such networks can be integrated into clinical workflow, it is crucial to understand their classification strategy. In this study, we propose to use a convolutional neural network to identify MS patients in combination with attribution algorithms to investigate the classification decisions. The network was trained using images acquired with susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), which is known to be sensitive to the presence of paramagnetic iron components and is routinely applied in imaging protocols for MS patients. Different attribution algorithms were used to the trained network resulting in heatmaps visualizing the contribution of each input voxel to the classification decision. Based on the quantitative image perturbation method, we selected DeepLIFT heatmaps for further investigation. Single-subject analysis revealed veins and adjacent voxels as signs for MS, while the population-based study revealed relevant brain areas common to most subjects in a class. This pattern was found to be stable across different echo times and also for a multi-echo trained network. Intensity analysis of the relevant voxels revealed a group difference, which was found to be primarily based on the T1w magnitude images, which are part of the SWI calculation. This difference was not observed in the phase mask data.","2020","2023-02-03 02:14:46","2023-02-03 02:14:46","2023-02-03 02:14:46","","","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/N3WDCAT9/Lopatina et al. - 2020 - Investigation of Deep-Learning-Driven Identificati.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neurodegeneration characterised by brain atrophy is recognised in the research field as an important prognostic factor. It is not routinely reported clinically, in part due to difficulty in achieving reproducible measurements. Automated MRI quantification of WM lesions and brain volume could provide important clinical monitoring data. In general, lesion quantification relies on both T1 and FLAIR input images, while tissue volumetry relies on T1. However, T1-weighted scans are not routinely included in the clinical MS protocol, limiting the utility of automated quantification. Objectives We address an aspect of this important translational challenge by assessing the performance of FLAIR-only lesion and brain segmentation, against a conventional approach requiring multi-contrast acquisition. We explore whether FLAIR-only grey matter (GM) segmentation yields more variability in performance compared with two-channel segmentation; whether this is related to field strength; and whether the results meet a level of clinical acceptability demonstrated by the ability to reproduce established biological associations. Methods We used a multicentre dataset of subjects with a CIS suggestive of MS scanned at 1.5T and 3T in the same week. WM lesions were manually segmented by two raters, ‘manual 1′ guided by consensus reading of CIS-specific lesions and ‘manual 2′ by any WM hyperintensity. An existing brain segmentation method was adapted for FLAIR-only input. Automated segmentation of WM hyperintensity and brain volumes were performed with conventional (T1/T1 + FLAIR) and FLAIR-only methods. Results WM lesion volumes were comparable at 1.5T between ‘manual 2′ and FLAIR-only methods and at 3T between ‘manual 2′, T1 + FLAIR and FLAIR-only methods. For cortical GM volume, linear regression measures between conventional and FLAIR-only segmentation were high (1.5T: α = 1.029, R2 = 0.997, standard error (SE) = 0.007; 3T: α = 1.019, R2 = 0.998, SE = 0.006). Age-associated change in cortical GM volume was a significant covariate in both T1 (p = 0.001) and FLAIR-only (p = 0.005) methods, confirming the expected relationship between age and GM volume for FLAIR-only segmentations. Conclusions FLAIR-only automated segmentation of WM lesions and brain volumes were consistent with results obtained through conventional methods and had the ability to demonstrate biological effects in our study population. Imaging protocol harmonisation and validation with other MS phenotypes could facilitate the integration of automated WM lesion volume and brain atrophy analysis as clinical tools in radiological MS reporting.","2021-01-01","2023-02-03 16:14:13","2023-02-03 16:14:13","2023-02-03 16:14:13","102542","","","29","","NeuroImage: Clinical","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/HPSBWPY6/Goodkin et al. - 2021 - FLAIR-only joint volumetric analysis of brain lesi.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/6E8CFJTD/S221315822030379X.html","","","Demyelinating diseases; Magnetic resonance imaging; Multiple sclerosis; Neurodegenerative diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, cortical lesions are hardly visible in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T, and thus their automated detection has been so far little explored. In this study, we propose a fully-convolutional deep learning approach, based on the 3D U-Net, for the automated segmentation of cortical and white matter lesions at 3T. For this purpose, we consider a clinically plausible MRI setting consisting of two MRI contrasts only: one conventional T2-weighted sequence (FLAIR), and one specialized T1-weighted sequence (MP2RAGE). We include 90 patients from two different centers with a total of 728 and 3856 gray and white matter lesions, respectively. We show that two reference methods developed for white matter lesion segmentation are inadequate to detect small cortical lesions, whereas our proposed framework is able to achieve a detection rate of 76% for both cortical and white matter lesions with a false positive rate of 29% in comparison to manual segmentation. Further results suggest that our framework generalizes well for both types of lesion in subjects acquired in two hospitals with different scanners.","2020-01-01","2023-02-03 16:20:31","2023-02-03 16:20:31","2023-02-03 16:20:31","102335","","","27","","NeuroImage: Clinical","Multiple sclerosis cortical and WM lesion segmentation at 3T MRI","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/FVLTISI4/La Rosa et al. - 2020 - Multiple sclerosis cortical and WM lesion segmenta.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/AW3JPYZA/S2213158220301728.html","","","CNN; Cortical lesions; FLAIR; MP2RAGE; MRI; Multiple sclerosis; Segmentation; U-Net","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, their review of deep learning methods did not go deep into the specific categories of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Algorithms based on deep learning reviewed are classified into two categories through their CNN style, and their strengths and weaknesses will also be given through our investigation and analysis. We give a quantitative comparison of the methods reviewed through two metrics: Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Positive Predictive Value (PPV). Finally, the future direction of the application of deep learning in MS lesion segmentation will be discussed.","2020","2023-02-03 16:23:04","2023-02-03 16:23:04","2023-02-03 16:23:04","","","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/ZZRQDTSL/Zeng et al. - 2020 - Review of Deep Learning Approaches for the Segment.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work we propose a fast and accurate deep learning based neuroimaging pipeline for the automated processing of structural human brain MRI scans, replicating FreeSurfer’s anatomical segmentation including surface reconstruction and cortical parcellation. To this end, we introduce an advanced deep learning architecture capable of whole-brain segmentation into 95 classes. The network architecture incorporates local and global competition via competitive dense blocks and competitive skip pathways, as well as multi-slice information aggregation that specifically tailor network performance towards accurate segmentation of both cortical and subcortical structures. Further, we perform fast cortical surface reconstruction and thickness analysis by introducing a spectral spherical embedding and by directly mapping the cortical labels from the image to the surface. This approach provides a full FreeSurfer alternative for volumetric analysis (in under 1 ​min) and surface-based thickness analysis (within only around 1 ​h runtime). For sustainability of this approach we perform extensive validation: we assert high segmentation accuracy on several unseen datasets, measure generalizability and demonstrate increased test-retest reliability, and high sensitivity to group differences in dementia.","2020-10-01","2023-02-03 17:08:22","2023-02-03 17:08:22","2023-02-03 17:08:22","117012","","","219","","NeuroImage","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/JWMU2FC4/Henschel et al. - 2020 - FastSurfer - A fast and accurate deep learning bas.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/XIBPHM8I/S1053811920304985.html","","","Artificial intelligence; Computational neuroimaging; Deep learning; Freesurfer; Structural MRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The training data consisted of five subjects with a mean of 4.4 time-points, and test data of fourteen subjects with a mean of 4.4 time-points. All 82 data sets had the white matter lesions associated with multiple sclerosis delineated by two human expert raters. Eleven teams submitted results using state-of-the-art lesion segmentation algorithms to the challenge, with ten teams presenting their results at the conference. We present a quantitative evaluation comparing the consistency of the two raters as well as exploring the performance of the eleven submitted results in addition to three other lesion segmentation algorithms. The challenge presented three unique opportunities: (1) the sharing of a rich data set; (2) collaboration and comparison of the various avenues of research being pursued in the community; and (3) a review and refinement of the evaluation metrics currently in use. We report on the performance of the challenge participants, as well as the construction and evaluation of a consensus delineation. The image data and manual delineations will continue to be available for download, through an evaluation website22The Challenge Evaluation Website is: http://smart-stats-tools.org/lesion-challenge-2015 as a resource for future researchers in the area.

T2-FLAIR MRI is a common denominator in clinical routine MS imaging, but current methods for thalamic volumetry are not applicable to it. Objective To develop and validate a robust algorithm to measure thalamic volume using clinical routine T2-FLAIR MRI. Methods A dual-stage deep learning approach based on 3D U-net (DeepGRAI – Deep Gray Rating via Artificial Intelligence) was created and trained/validated/tested on 4,590 MRI exams (4288 2D-FLAIR, 302 3D-FLAIR) from 59 centers (80/10/10 train/validation/test split). As training/test targets, FIRST was used to generate thalamic masks from 3D T1 images. Masks were reviewed, corrected, and aligned into T2-FLAIR space. Additional validation was performed to assess inter-scanner reliability (177 subjects at 1.5 T and 3 T within one week) and scan-rescan-reliability (5 subjects scanned, repositioned, and then re-scanned). A longitudinal dataset including assessment of disability and cognition was used to evaluate the predictive value of the approach. Results DeepGRAI automatically quantified thalamic volume in approximately 7 s per case, and has been made publicly available. Accuracy on T2-FLAIR relative to 3D T1 FIRST was 99.4% (r = 0.94, p < 0.001,TPR = 93.0%, FPR = 0.3%). Inter-scanner error was 3.21%. Scan-rescan error with repositioning was 0.43%. DeepGRAI-derived thalamic volume was associated with disability (r = -0.427,p < 0.001) and cognition (r = -0.537,p < 0.001), and was a significant predictor of longitudinal cognitive decline (R2 = 0.081, p = 0.024; comparatively, FIRST-derived volume was R2 = 0.080, p = 0.025). Conclusions DeepGRAI provides fast, reliable, and clinically relevant thalamic volume measurement on multicenter clinical-quality T2-FLAIR images. This indicates potential for real-world thalamic volumetry, as well as quantification on legacy datasets without 3D T1 imaging.","2021-01-01","2023-02-03 17:16:54","2023-02-03 17:16:54","2023-02-03 17:16:54","102652","","","30","","NeuroImage: Clinical","DeepGRAI (Deep Gray Rating via Artificial Intelligence)","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/V4XHGICF/Dwyer et al. - 2021 - DeepGRAI (Deep Gray Rating via Artificial Intellig.pdf; /Users/mgdwyer/Zotero/storage/WYEEYVKM/S2213158221000966.html","","","Artificial intelligence; Multiple sclerosis; Thalamic atrophy; Thalamus volume","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
